# Graph_Theory_Project
by Rose Downes

In this repository I have a single Jupyter notebook called graph_isomorphism.ipynb on the topic of the Graph Isomorphism Problem.

Also in this repository I have a folder called 'data' where I store all the data from the project. 

I also have a folder with some lab work called 'LabWork'.
